In most cases, you will not need this. But if things really go wrong, this might save you from a catastrophe.

Emergency stop for the printer: pull out the power plug.
The program is already on the 3D printer. Stopping the program on the computer does NOT stop the printer.

Emergency stop for the pressure: push the button on arduino or turn off the pressure source.
Again, the python interface will NOT help you stop the pressure.
